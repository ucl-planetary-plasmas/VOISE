MATLAB Compiler

1. Prerequisites for Deployment 

  Read any of the readme*.txt files: 

	  -readme-gVOISE.txt, 
	  -readme-VOISE.txt, 
	  -readme-verifyImage.txt

	They should contain the necessary instructions for deployment of standalone
	MATLAB compiled application for your specific platform.


2.  How to run gVOISE (graphic VOISE), VOISE and verifyImage

  Each compiled application APP has a corresponding shell script run_APP.sh 
	for temporarily setting environment variables and executing.

  To run the shell script, type
   
	     ./run_APP.sh <mcr_directory> <argument_list>

       
    at Linux or Mac command prompt. <mcr_directory> is the directory 
    where the MATLAB runtime is installed or the directory where 
    MATLAB is installed on the machine. <argument_list> is all the 
    arguments you want to pass to your application. For example, 

       ./run_gVOISE.sh <mcr_directory> <VOISE_config_file>
       ./run_VOISE.sh <mcr_directory> <VOISE_config_file>
       ./run_verifyImage.sh <mcr_directory> <image_file>

    If you have version 8.4 of the MATLAB runtime installed in 
    /mathworks/home/application/v84, run the shell script as:
    
       ./run_gVOISE.sh /mathworks/home/application/v84 ../share/VOISEdemo3.dat
       
    If you have MATLAB installed in /mathworks/devel/application/matlab, 
    run the shell script as:
    
       ./run_gVOISE.sh /mathworks/devel/application/matlab ../share/VOISEdemo3.dat
